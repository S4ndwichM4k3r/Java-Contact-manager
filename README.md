# Java-Contact-manager
This is a base for the code for a contact manager using arrays in Java.

As you can see from the file names, this is a lab from one of my classes, specifically CS232.
What this Program does is it uses arrays to create a contact with a name and a corresponding number. 
This program is mainly used to teach the uses of arrays in Java, and because of this there is no real way
to save and edit these listings in any real way. The listings are purely made for testing purposes and the added
listings by the user will not be saved.

# Function
This program ties a number to a name using two seperate arrays, and calls upon the information of the number once the corresponding
name has been searched by the user. If the user inputs a number not listed inside of the contact list, the user is prompted to provide
a number to this unknown listing by the program. This listing is then added to the array of contacts for the remainder of the time the
program runs. This program can add up to 30 total listings before a hard cap of names is reached.
